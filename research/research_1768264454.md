**Created:** 2026-01-13T00:34:14Z  
**Purpose:** Human-readable knowledge, not code.

This document represents *growth in place*.

The page is not finished.
It is *becoming*.

As users explore, they discover what is missing:
- a chart
- a comparison
- a definition
- a timeline

Those absences are signals.

Future machines respond by adding structure,
but this text remains the narrative spine.

This is how pages grow *in front of the reader*.
